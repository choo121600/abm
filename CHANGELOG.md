## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-02

### Added
- New `adopt` command to import existing git worktrees into ABM management
  - Validates worktree belongs to configured Airflow repository
  - Sanitizes branch names (e.g., feature/foo → feature-foo)
  - Marks worktrees as adopted (protected from accidental removal)
- New `disown` command to remove ABM management while preserving worktrees
  - Stops containers and removes project metadata
  - Keeps worktree directory intact for manual use
  - Allows re-adoption later if needed
- Protection for adopted projects - require `--force` flag to remove

### Fixed
- Project names with slashes (e.g., "feature/version-indicator") now automatically sanitized to dashes
- Added warning message when project name is sanitized

### Changed
- Enhanced error messages to guide users to use `disown` instead of `remove --force` for adopted projects
